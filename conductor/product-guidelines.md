# Product Guidelines - FortiCam

## User Interaction & Tone
- **Minimalist & Action-Oriented:** The interface should prioritize clarity and speed. Reduce visual noise to focus the user's attention on the primary status monitoring and port control tasks.
- **Professional Efficiency:** Use clear, concise language for instructions and labels, ensuring that the most frequent actions (searching, filtering, toggling) require minimal effort.

## Feedback & Responsiveness
- **Immediate Visual Confirmation:** Users must receive instant feedback upon taking action. The UI should reflect state changes immediately, supplemented by responsive success or failure notifications.
- **Safe Delegation:** To balance speed with accountability, critical changes (like port toggles) should prompt for a brief justification to ensure the audit log remains meaningful.
- **Graceful Error Recovery:** Technical failures (e.g., API timeouts) should be translated into actionable, user-friendly messages rather than raw stack traces.

## Design Identity
- **Glassmorphism Aesthetic:** Maintain a premium, modern feel using subtle transparency and background blur effects. This style should enhance depth without compromising legibility or performance.
