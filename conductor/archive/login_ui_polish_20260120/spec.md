# Specification: Login Screen UI Polish

## Overview
Based on user feedback from `1111.png`, the login screen textboxes and button lack visual polish. This track will enhance the CSS specifically for the login card to provide a more modern, professional, and accessible entry point.

## Functional Requirements
1.  **Enhanced Textboxes:**
    *   Increase padding and border-radius.
    *   Add distinct borders with subtle shadows.
    *   Implement vibrant focus states (border color change, glow).
    *   Better alignment of icons within inputs.
2.  **Modern Action Button:**
    *   Change the "Giriş Yap" button to a primary action style.
    *   Use a gradient background (e.g., Blue to Indigo).
    *   Add hover effects (scaling, shadow depth).
    *   Set to full width for better balance.
3.  **Layout & Spacing:**
    *   Optimize margins between elements (Logo -> Title -> Inputs -> Button).
    *   Ensure the card remains centered and responsive.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Textboxes look "filled" and premium with clear focus indicators.
- [ ] The "Giriş Yap" button is clearly the primary action with a modern gradient.
- [ ] Visual alignment matches the professional aesthetic of the Bakanlık branding.
- [ ] No more "TypeError" or formatting issues in the CSS injection.
